This is how you compile:
aclocal
autoconf
automake -a
./configure
make

To build backwords compatible one can do configure and make like this;
./configure --prefix=/metno/local/ --includedir=/metno/local/include/puCtools
make && make install

The new(NEWS, AUTHORS ChangeLog README) files are there by convention from automake 1.7. Can be removed on later versions of automake.
